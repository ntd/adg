/**
 * SECTION:adg-trail
 * @short_description: A bare model built around cairo path
 *
 * The #AdgTrail model is a really basic model built around the #cairo_path_t
 * struct: for a full fledged path model consider using #AdgPath.
 *
 * A trail is a path model that demands all the implementation details to
 * the caller: this requires a deep knowledge of the ADG details but
 * provides a great customization level. It should be used when an
 * #AdgPath is not enough, such as when a model is subject to change
 * dynamically and the global and local maps do not suffice to express
 * this alteration. A typical example is the path used to draw extension
 * lines and base line of #AdgLDim: every point is subject to different
 * constrains not expressible with a single affine transformation.
 *
 * Since: 1.0
 **/

/**
 * AdgTrail:
 *
 * All fields are private and should not be used directly.
 * Use its public methods instead.
 *
 * Since: 1.0
 **/

/**
 * AdgTrailClass:
 * @get_cairo_path: virtual method to get the #cairo_path_t bound to the trail.
 *
 * The default @get_cairo_path calls the #AdgTrailCallback callback passed
 * to adg_trail_new() during construction. No caching is performed in
 * between.
 *
 * Since: 1.0
 **/

/**
 * AdgTrailCallback:
 * @trail: an #AdgTrail
 * @user_data: the general purpose pointer set by adg_trail_new()
 *
 * This is the callback used to generate the #cairo_path_t and it is
 * called directly by adg_trail_cairo_path(). The caller owns
 * the returned path, that is the finalization of the returned
 * #cairo_path_t should be made by the caller when appropriate.
 *
 * Returns: the #cairo_path_t of this trail model
