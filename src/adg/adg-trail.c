/**
 * SECTION:adg-trail
 * @short_description: A bare model built around #CpmlPath
 *
 * The #AdgTrail model is a really basic model built around the #CpmlPath
 * struct: for a full fledged path model consider using #AdgPath.
 *
 * A trail is a path model that demands all the implementation details to
 * the caller: this requires a deep knowledge of the ADG details but
 * provides a great customization level. It should be used when an
 * #AdgPath is not enough, such as when a model is subject to change
 * dynamically and the global and local maps do not suffice to express
 * this alteration. A typical example is the path used to draw extension
 * lines and base line of #AdgLDim: every point is subject to different
 * constrains not expressible with a single affine transformation.
 **/

/**
 * AdgTrail:
 *
 * All fields are private and should not be used directly.
 * Use its public methods instead.
 **/

/**
 * AdgTrailCallback:
 * @trail: an #AdgTrail
 * @user_data: the general purpose pointer set by adg_trail_new()
 *
 * This is the callback used to generate the #CpmlPath and it is
 * called directly by adg_trail_cpml_path(). The caller owns
 * the returned path, that is the finalization of the returned
 * #CpmlPath should be made by the caller when appropriate.
 *
 * Returns: the #CpmlPath of this trail model
