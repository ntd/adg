 *
 * The dress is a virtualization of an #AdgStyle instance. #AdgEntity
 * objects do not directly refer to #AdgStyle but use #AdgDress values
 * instead. This allows some advanced operations, such as overriding
 * a dress only in a specific entity branch of the hierarchy or
 * customize multiple entities at once.
