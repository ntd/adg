/**

 * @Section_Id:AdgDash
 * @title: AdgDash
 * @short_description: Dash pattern for line stroking
 *
 * The #AdgDash boxed type wraps the values needed by cairo to
 * univoquely identify a dash pattern, an array of positive values. Each
 * value provides the length of alternate "on" and "off" portions of the
 * stroke. The offset specifies an offset into the pattern at which the
 * stroke begins.
 *
 * Each "on" segment will have caps applied as if the segment were a
 * separate sub-path. In particular, it is valid to use an "on" length of
 * 0 with %CAIRO_LINE_CAP_ROUND or %CAIRO_LINE_CAP_SQUARE in order to
 * distribute dots or squares along a path.
 *
 * Check the cairo_set_dash() documentation for further details:
 * http://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-cairo-t.html#cairo-set-dash
