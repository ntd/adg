/**
 * AdgTransformMode:
 * @ADG_TRANSFORM_NONE:              do not apply any transformation: the
 *                                   matrix is returned unchanged
 * @ADG_TRANSFORM_BEFORE:            apply the transformation before the
 *                                   matrix: the result is equivalent to
 *                                   cairo_matrix_multiply(matrix, transformation, matrix)
 * @ADG_TRANSFORM_AFTER:             apply the transformation after the
 *                                   matrix: the result is equivalent to
 *                                   cairo_matrix_multiply(matrix, matrix, transformation)
 * @ADG_TRANSFORM_BEFORE_NORMALIZED: same as %ADG_TRANSFORM_BEFORE but
 *                                   normalizing the transformation with
 *                                   adg_matrix_normalize() before applying it
 * @ADG_TRANSFORM_AFTER_NORMALIZED:  same as %ADG_TRANSFORM_AFTER but

 *                                   adg_matrix_normalize() before applying it
 *
 * Specifies the mode a generic transformation should be applied on
 * a matrix. Although used in different places, the function performing
 * the dirty work is always adg_matrix_transform().

/**
 * AdgMix:
 * @ADG_MIX_UNDEFINED: undefined method, mainly used to return an
 *                     error condition
 * @ADG_MIX_DISABLED:  the maps are completely ignored: the matrix is
 *                     always set to the identity matrix
 * @ADG_MIX_NONE:      the matrix is set to the entity map
 * @ADG_MIX_ANCESTORS: sequentially apply every map on the matrix using
 *                     %ADG_TRANSFORM_BEFORE #AdgTransformMode, starting
 *                     from the elder ancestor in the hierarchy
 *                     (probably an #AdgCanvas) up to the current entity
 * @ADG_MIX_ANCESTORS_NORMALIZED:
 *                     perform the same operations as %ADG_MIX_ANCESTORS
 *                     but normalize the resulting matrix with
 *                     adg_matrix_normalize() before returning it
 * @ADG_MIX_PARENT:    similar to %ADG_MIX_ANCESTORS but taking into account
 *                     only the parent and ignoring any other ancestors;
 *                     if the entity has no parent, it returns the
 *                     entity map as in %ADG_MIX_NONE
 * @ADG_MIX_PARENT_NORMALIZED:
 *                     perform the same operations as %ADG_MIX_PARENT
 *                     but normalize the resulting matrix with
 *                     adg_matrix_normalize() before returning it
 *
 * Specifies how the maps of an #AdgEntity instance and its ancestors
 * should be combined to get the matrix. The full logic is implemented
 * by the #AdgEntity::local-changed default handler to compute the
 * local matrix, while the global matrix is always computed using the
 * #ADG_MIX_ANCESTORS method.

 * @ADG_PROJECTION_SCHEME_FIRST_ANGLE: the views are generated as if the object
 *                                     were sitting on the paper and, from the
